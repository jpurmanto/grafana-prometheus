# compose-prometheus

## This is a docker-compose stack created for a test enviroment to monitor MOC network switches. It consits of a working SNMP exporter with Prometheus and Grafana. 

# Pre-requisites

1. Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your system

2. In *prometheus/prometheus.yml*, replace ```INSERT IPs, can insert a list``` with the IP address of the target switches.

3. In *snmp_exporter/snmp.yml*, replace ```COMMUNITY_STRING``` with the community string of the SNMP device (it should be the last line of the file)

# Running

1. Generate the `snmp.yml` file with `docker-compose -f compose-generator.yml up`
2. Run the docker-compose stack with `docker-compose up`

# Please note

1. Prometheus is running on port 9990
2. Grafana is running on port 3110
3. Exporter is running on port 9116

Prometheus and Grafana are not running on their default ports because the test VM already had those provisioned.
